# Node README Generator

## Description

This project was created to help save some time formatting a projects README file. You are currently reading the output of the README generated from this repository. The aim is to make developers lives easier when writing up their README, this is done through a series of easy to answer prompts. README files are important and communicate what a project is about. Therefore an application such as this is a valuable asset. This project was a great introduction into node and backend development and I look forward to seeing what else is possible on the backend.
